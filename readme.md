Recently I got certified as Hadoop and Spark Developer - CCA175 and I wanted to share my experience about the test and training in this repository.

With all those that want to try it I share a huge part of the theory and especially a lot of hands-on, more than 150 which will surely be helpful for those who want to try the test or just learn about all the technologies around the test which are part of the Big Data ecosystem.
Technologies such as: Hadoop, Spark, Spark Streaming, Sqoop, Flume, Kafka, Hive.....

Some aspects of the exam: it takes two hours, it requires 70% marks to pass and it can have between eight and twelve questions (in my case there were nine).

The test is taken online through a virtual machine that you will access from your computer's web browser (chrome), and it will be neccessary to have a webcam through which a proctor will be watching you so you cannot copy anything, also you will have available web links to documentations about the tools that you can use in the exam, such as the official documentation for Spark, Sqoop, Hive and so on.
