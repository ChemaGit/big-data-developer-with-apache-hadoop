/**
 * Problem Scenario 23 : You have been given log generating service as below.
 * Start_logs (It will generate continuous logs)
 * Tail_logs (You can check , what logs are being generated)
 * Stop_logs (It will stop the log service)
 * Path where logs are generated using above service : /opt/gen_logs/logs/access.log
 * Now write a flume configuration file named flume3.conf , using that configuration file dumps
 * logs in HDFS file system in a directory called flume3/%Y/%m/%d/%H/%M
 * Means every minute new directory should be created). Please us the interceptors to
 * provide timestamp information, if message header does not have header info.
 * And also note that you have to preserve existing timestamp, if message contains it. Flume
 * channel should have following property as well. After every 100 message it should be
 * committed, use non-durable/faster channel and it should be able to hold maximum 1000 events.

//Explanation: Solution : 
//Step 1 : Create flume configuration file, with below configuration for source, sink and channel. 
#Define source , sink , channel and agent, 
agent1.sources = source1 
agent1.sinks = sink1 
agent1.channels = channel1 

# Describe/configure source1 
agent1.sources.source1.type = exec 
agent1.sources.source1.command = tail -F /opt/gen_logs/logs/access.log 
agent1.sources.source1.channels = channel1

#Define interceptors 
agent1.sources.source1.interceptors = i1 
agent1.sources.source1.interceptors.i1.type = timestamp 
agent1.sources.source1.interceptors.i1.preserveExisting = true 

# Describe sink1 
agent1.sinks.sink1.channel = channel1 
agent1.sinks.sink1.type = hdfs 
agent1.sinks.sink1.hdfs.path = flume3/%Y/%m/%d/%H/%M 
agent1.sinks.sink1.hdfs.fileType = DataStream 

# Now we need to define channel1 property. 
agent1.channels.channel1.type = memory 
agent1.channels.channel1.capacity = 1000 
agent1.channels.channel1.transactionCapacity = 100 

//Step 2 : Run below command which will use this configuration file and append data in hdfs. Start log service using : 
$ start_logs 
//Start flume service: 
$ flume-ng agent --conf /home/cloudera/flumeconf --conf-file /home/cloudera/flumeconf/flume3.conf --name agent1
$ flume-ng agent --conf /home/cloudera/flumeconf --conf-file /home/cloudera/flumeconf/flume3.conf --name agent1 -Dflume.root.logger=DEBUG,INFO,console
//Wait for few mins and than stop log service. 
$ stop_logs
