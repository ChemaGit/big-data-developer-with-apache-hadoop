Structured data: SQL, Dataframes, and Datasets
With our newfound understanding of the cost of data movement in a Spark job, and some experience optimizing jobs for data locality last week, this week we'll focus on how we can more easily achieve similar optimizations. Can structured data help us? We'll look at Spark SQL and its powerful optimizer which uses structure to apply impressive optimizations. We'll move on to cover DataFrames and Datasets, which give us a way to mix RDDs with the powerful automatic optimizations behind Spark SQL.
